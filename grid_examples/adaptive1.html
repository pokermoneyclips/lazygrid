			<div class="gridspan_12_span5">
				<p>The container here is being resized multiple times to create several rescaling points. This is being done via media queries.</p>
				<p>There is a 20 pixel buffer (+20) added to all values provided as the min point because Chrome and Firefox view breakpoints differently based on the scrollbar. The extra 20 pixels is a hack to prevent any sort of wrapping anywhere.</p>
				<p><em>I might take out the +20 pixel buffer in the future depending on how much trouble that causes, or make some sort of other adjustment.</em></p>
				<p>Here's the code:</p>
				<code>

$sizes: 720 800 880 960;
@each $widths in $sizes {
	@include media_query_minonly($widths) {
		##{$container_name} {
			max-width: $widths/$font_px +0em;
			margin: 0 auto;
			background:#fff;
		}
	}
}
				</code>
				<p>The $sizes list are the values I want to set up as the breakpoints. The width needed to be converted from pixels to ems so I took the pixel value and divided it by the base font size (which is also in pixels.)</p>

		<div class="gridspan_12_span3">
			<p>This content comes second in our markup.</p>
			<p>And our 100% height background colors on all of these columns is being provided using the same trick that was used for percentages</p>

		</div>
		
		<div class="gridspan_12_span4">
			<p>This comes third.</p>
			<p>We used the following mixins</p>
			<code>

@include mobile_grid (3) {background:#ccc;};
@include mobile_grid (4) {background:#000;color:#fff;};
@include mobile_grid (5) {background:#FF0000;};

@each $query in $sizes {
	@include media_minonly (3, $query);
	@include media_minonly (5, $query);
	@include media_minonly (4, $query);
}
			</code>
			<p>The each query here is using the same list that the container used</p>
