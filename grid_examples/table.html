				<p>To minimize the evil of the display:table-cell its only available in a min / max mixin to be used between the small and large display size.</p>
				<p>Table cell must be contained within a wrapper with the display:table attribute. Table-cells will wrap to other elements if they are anywhere near eachother and don't have a proper wrapper.</p>
			</div>
			
		
			<div class="gridspan_12_span5">
				<p>The Table cell element does however produce something that I really wanted in design, which was a min and max width for columns without using percentages. By setting a width on an element with display:table-cell it'll treat that width as a max-width, meaning it can shrink below but never grow above.</p>

				<p>The margin property also doesn't work with table cells and must be applied elsewhere. You could place another element inside the table cell and apply padding or margins to it to get the correct spacing you're going for or apply border-collapse and border properties to the element with display:table</p>
