			<div class="content_inner">
				<p>The container element has a set width on it to prevent any sort of shrinkage or resizing. This is a standard no non-sense fixed width page.</p>
				<p>This content comes first in our body markup. There is a wrapper around the 3 columns called body_wrapper that was not produced by the grid system (but technically could have been using _variables.scss and a for loop)</p>
				<p>The #id content_wrap is where all the magic happens. Using the following code:</p>
				<code>
				<pre>
#content_wrap {
	@extend %push_4;
	@extend %pull_3;
	@extend %pushpull;
}
				</pre>
				</code>
				<p>We are able to create this region in the center. The @extend %push_4 and %pull_3 set the correct padding to the left and right to float our sidebars correctly. The %pushpull sets the additional markup to get everything to cooperate.</p>

		<div class="gridspan_12_span3 pull_3">
			<p>This content comes second in our markup.</p>
			<p>We used the following mixins</p>
			<code>

@include column_combine (3);
@include combine_pushpull(3, pull);

			</code>
			<p>Column_combine sets our width and combine_pushpull sets the correct negative margin and float position.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="gridspan_12_span4 push_4">
			<p>This content comes third in our markup.</p>
			<p>We used the following mixins</p>
			<code>

@include column_combine (4) {color:#fff;};
@include combine_pushpull(4);

			</code>
			<p>Column_combine sets the width. I included color as its on a black background. Combine_pushpull sets the push for negative margin and float. There is no secondary argument because push is default.</p>
