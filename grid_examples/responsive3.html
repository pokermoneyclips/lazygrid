				<p>This demo is almost identical to the other pushing and pulling responsive demo with 1 exception: we set a max-width on our container element - named #container.</p>
				<code>
				<pre>
##{$container_name} {
	max-width: $page_width_em +0em;
	margin: 0 auto;
}				</pre>
				</code>
				<p>$container_name is a variable from the _variables.scss file. I also also added some background colors for the header and this main_content area to illustrate the regions.</p>
				<p>This content comes first in our body markup. There is a wrapper around the 3 columns called body_wrapper that was not produced by the grid system (but technically could have been using _variables.scss and a for loop)</p>
				<p>The #id main_content is where all the magic happens. Using the following code:</p>
				<code>
				<pre>
#main_content {
	width: 100%;
	float: left;
	margin-right: -100%;
	@extend %push_2;
	@extend %pull_4;
}
				</pre>
				</code>
				<p>We are able to create this region in the center. The @extend %push_2 and %pull_4 set the correct padding to the left and right to float our sidebars correctly.

		<div class="gridspan_12_span4_up pull_4">
			<p>This content comes second in our markup.</p>
			<p>We used the following mixins</p>
			<code>

@include percent_mobile (4);
@include percent_tablet (4) {float:left;};
@include percent_combine (4, up);
@include percent_pushnpull (4, up, pull);

			</code>
			<p>Percent_mobile is used for our mobile first design. Percent_tablet is used to double the width of this column at a specific breakpoint. Percent_combine and percent_pushpull generate the width and negative margins for larger displays.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="gridspan_12_span2_down push_2">
			<p>This content comes third in our markup.</p>
			<p>We used the following mixins</p>
			<code>

@include percent_mobile (2);

@include percent_tablet (2) {float:left;};

@include percent_combine (2, down);

@include percent_pushnpull (2, down, push);

			</code>
			<p>We used down to round this value down so our columns would equal 100% (2 and 4 both rounded up would be over 100%). We pushed to float this element to the left making it appear as though its first on the screen.</p>
